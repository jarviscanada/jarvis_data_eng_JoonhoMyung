# Joonho Myung . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University, currently changed their name to Toronto Metropolitan University, with a Bachelor of Science (Honours). During my education, I learned software engineering, the fundamentals of data structure, and familiarized myself with various coding languages. I can work on projects with many different languages which are Java, the language most I'm proficient with, SQL, HTTP/CSS, and Bash. I'm currently working as Software Developer from Jarvis Consulting Group and I'm working on improving my skill sets to be prepared for the workspace. I am using an agile approach to manage my projects and these projects enable me to widen the ability to use new technologies like Docker and PostgreSQL.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed and written bash scripts using terminal and used various technologies to save hardware specifications and resource usage data into database using Docker container and PSQL instance. This script was executed to manage the Linux cluster running on Linux distro CentOS 7. Also, CRONTAB command was used in monitoring agent to record resource usage of each node in real-time.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Implemented Java Grep Application that mimics Linux grep command which allows users to search matching strings from files. The application was dockerized using Docker container and implemented using various technologies which are Maven, Stream APIs, Java Regex and Lambda.
  - JDBC App: Implemented Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application which connects to PostgreSQL database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the database. The application used various technologies which are Java, JDBC, Maven, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.

## Highlighted Projects
**Smart Service for Car Rental**: Created websites for ride and delivery services. Worked in a group and used front-end and back-end languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Angular, and Javascript. On this website, users can sign up and purchase a ride with the specific vehicle they want. Also, the user can order delivery for the flower and food items they want. The group projects were contributed by each group member using GitHub.

**Movie Recommender System**: Created a Java program that recommends a movie to the user by analyzing other users' databases. Looks for the user who has a similar tendency and recommends their high-rated movie which the user hasn't watched yet.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Worked on projects with a team of software developers and employed an Agile approach for the projects. Worked on technologies like GitHub, Docker, and PostgreSQL. The agile environment helped developers have daily scrum meetings and the sprint for Jarvis which uses a two-week sprint. Various projects using different languages and concepts were developed and one of the developers became a team lead for the sprint and was responsible for daily scrum meetings, listening, and monitoring whether to team member is heading in the right direction or had any obstacles stopping them to accomplish the work.
