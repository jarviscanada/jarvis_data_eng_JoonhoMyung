# Joonho Myung . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science. During my education, I learned software engineering, and the fundamentals of data structures, and became comfortable with various coding languages most notably Java, SQL, C/C++, and Bash. I'm currently working as Software Developer from Teranet Inc., working on SEDAR+. Working on a systme like SEDAR+ improved my ability to detect where it has defect and optimize the system for better performance. Before Teranet Inc. I worked in Jarvis. I used an agile approach to manage my projects and these projects help me to improve my capabilities with industry-standard technologies like Docker, PostgreSQL, and Maven. I decided to apply for a developer position because there is a big sense of achievement when you solve a problem. I love being a developer because it's all about problem-solving. It brings the feeling of achievement every day and this is one of my motivations to work hard.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed and wrote bash scripts using terminal and used various technologies to save hardware specifications and resource usage data into PostgreSQL database using Docker container. This script was executed to manage the Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. Also, the cron was used in monitoring agent to record resource usage of each node in real-time.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JoonhoMyung/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Implemented Java Twitter application which uses Twitter REST API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation and allow users to post/show/delete the tweet object on Twitter Developer Account. This application used various technologies which are Java, Maven, JUnit, Mockito, Spring, REST API, and Docker. First, Maven was used for creating a JAR file to package the project. Second, JUnit and Mockito were used for integration and unit testing of the project. Third, Spring was used to manage dependency using the IoC container. Fourth, REST API was used to send HTTP requests to Twitter to access and use Twitter data. Lastly, Docker was used for dockerizing the project, and docker image was uploaded to DockerHub for deployment.
  - JDBC App: Implemented Java Database Connectivity application which connects to PostgreSQL database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the database. The application used various technologies which are Java, JDBC, Maven, and PostgreSQL. First, JDBC was used to allow Java programs to access PostGreSQL. Second, Maven was used to manage projects and help downloading dependencies to keep it up-to-date.
  - Grep App: Implemented Java Grep Application that mimics the Linux grep command which allows users to search matching strings from files. The application was deployed using Docker container and implemented using various technologies. The technologies used in this project are Maven, Stream APIs, Java Regex and Lambda. First, Maven was used to manage projects and help downloading dependencies to keep it up-to-date. Second, Stream API allowed me to process collections of objects so objects were pipelined to produce desired result. Third, Lambda expression enabled me to use functional programming structure in Java. Lastly, Java Regex was used to find matching string from the text file.


## Highlighted Projects
**Smart Service for Car Rental**: Created websites for ride and delivery services. Worked in a group and used front-end and back-end languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Angular, and Javascript. On this website, users can sign up and purchase a ride with the specific vehicle they want. Also, the user can order delivery for the flower and food items they want. The group projects were contributed by each group member using GitHub.

**Movie Recommender System**: Created a Java program that recommends a movie to the user by analyzing other users' databases. Looks for the user who has a similar tendency and recommends their high-rated movie which the user hasn't watched yet. For the front end, I used Java Swing for GUI to let users interact with the database.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Worked on projects with a team of software developers and employed an Agile approach for the projects. Worked on technologies like GitHub, Docker, and PostgreSQL. The agile environment helped developers have daily scrum meetings and the sprint for Jarvis which uses a two-week sprint. Various projects using different languages and concepts were developed and one of the developers became a team lead for the sprint and was responsible for daily scrum meetings, listening, and monitoring whether to team member is heading in the right direction or had any obstacles stopping them to accomplish the work.

**Teranet Inc. (2023-present)**: Worked on SEDAR+ which is secured web-based system that allows all the participants of market to file, manage and search about capital markets in Canada. Mainly worked on defects raised on client's side to implement and provide correct and quick solution. Worked on performance defects to improve time which takes to run specific services provided by SEDAR+. Also, worked on display defects to make sure everything is displayed correctly in webpage. Used Java/Groovy/XML to provide solution which matches the business requirements provided by business analysts.
