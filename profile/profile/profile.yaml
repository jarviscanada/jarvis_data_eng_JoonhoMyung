# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University, currently changed their name to Toronto Metropolitan University, with a Bachelor of Science (Honours). During my education, I learned software engineering, the fundamentals of data structure, and familiarized myself with various coding languages. I can work on projects with many different languages which are Java, the language most I'm proficient with, SQL, HTTP/CSS, and Bash. I'm currently working as Software Developer from Jarvis Consulting Group and I'm working on improving my skill sets to be prepared for the workspace. I am using an agile approach to manage my projects and these projects enable me to widen the ability to use new technologies like Docker and PostgreSQL.
