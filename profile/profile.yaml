summary: I'm currently working as Software Developer from Teranet Inc., working on a project SEDAR+. Working on a project like SEDAR+ improved my ability to detect system defects and ability to optimize the system for better performance. Before Teranet, I've been working in Jarvis. We were using an agile approach to manage my projects and these projects help me to improve my capabilities with industry-standard technologies like Docker, PostgreSQL, and Maven. I decided to apply for a developer position because there is a big sense of achievement when you solve a problem. I graduated Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science. During my education, I learned software engineering, and the fundamentals of data structures, and became comfortable with various coding languages most notably Java, SQL, C/C++, and Bash. I love being a developer because it's all about problem-solving. It brings the feeling of achievement every day and this is one of my motivations to work hard.

    description: Developed and wrote bash scripts using terminal and used various technologies to save hardware specifications and resource usage data into PostgreSQL database using Docker container. This script was executed to manage the Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. Also, the cron was used in monitoring agent to record resource usage of each node in real-time.

    description:
      - "Twitter App: Implemented Java Twitter application which uses Twitter REST API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation and allow users to post/show/delete the tweet object on Twitter Developer Account. This application used various technologies which are Java, Maven, JUnit, Mockito, Spring, REST API, and Docker. First, Maven was used for creating a JAR file to package the project. Second, JUnit and Mockito were used for integration and unit testing of the project. Third, Spring was used to manage dependency using the IoC container. Fourth, REST API was used to send HTTP requests to Twitter to access and use Twitter data. Lastly, Docker was used for dockerizing the project, and docker image was uploaded to DockerHub for deployment."
      - "JDBC App: Implemented Java Database Connectivity application which connects to PostgreSQL database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the database. The application used various technologies which are Java, JDBC, Maven, and PostgreSQL. First, JDBC was used to allow Java programs to access PostGreSQL. Second, Maven was used to manage projects and help downloading dependencies to keep it up-to-date."
      - "Grep App: Implemented Java Grep Application that mimics the Linux grep command which allows users to search matching strings from files. The application was deployed using Docker container and implemented using various technologies. The technologies used in this project are Maven, Stream APIs, Java Regex and Lambda. First, Maven was used to manage projects and help downloading dependencies to keep it up-to-date. Second, Stream API allowed me to process collections of objects so objects were pipelined to produce desired result. Third, Lambda expression enabled me to use functional programming structure in Java. Lastly, Java Regex was used to find matching string from the text file."
